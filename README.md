# Pythings â€“ Creative Code Puzzles

[My Notes](notes.md)

Pythings is a python learning website. You solve puzzles and make cool pixel art by writing Python code. Try game levels (like coding your way through a maze), drawing challenges (where you match a picture using code), or just freestyle your own art. See your code run instantly, get feedback, and share your creations with friends!


> [!NOTE]
>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

> [!NOTE]
>  If you are not familiar with Markdown then you should review the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) before continuing.

>  Fill in this sections as the submission artifact for this deliverable. You can refer to this [example](https://github.com/webprogramming260/startup-example/blob/main/README.md) for inspiration.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features
- [x] Description of how you will use each technology

### ðŸš€ Elevator Pitch
Pythings is a web platform where users solve visual puzzles and create art by writing Python code, allowing people to learn python in a fun environment. You can play games, make art, and even compete with friends. There is also a tutorial to get you set up with the basics. 


### Design
![Design image](sceetch.png)
I plan to make it snaked themed (because python), with green and black being the main color scheme. You can see the tentative designs of a terminal and game environment as well.

## âœ¨ Key Features
- **User Authentication:** Register, login, and track your progress.
- **In-Browser Python Editor:** Write and run code with a Bit-like API.
- **Beginner Mode:** Learn how to code in python with guided tutorials. 
- **Challenge Mode:** Take on geometry challenges, code a character through mazes, or replicate a picture.
- **Free Mode:** Design challenges for yourself and others, create a nice work of art, or simply code. 
- **Auto-Grading & Scoring:** System checks your solution and updates leaderboards.
- **Sharing** View and comment on art made by the community, and try to beat their challenges.
